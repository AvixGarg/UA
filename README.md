Cracking the code for Call Center Success

This project focuses on optimizing United Airlines' call center operations by improving key metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The goal is to reduce inefficiencies, enhance customer service, and improve operational performance. Through data analysis, the project identifies drivers of long handling and wait times, and suggests improvements to the IVR system to reduce escalations to agents. The outcome is aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and streamlining call center operations.
